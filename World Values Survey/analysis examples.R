# fake survey design object #
#############################

# # # # # # #
# user note #
# # # # # # #

# the public use microdata of the world values survey
# waves 1 through 6 do not allow users to calculate
# a survey-adjusted standard error, because the wvs team
# did not require countries to submit their cluster variables

# therefore, standard errors calculated with this object are incorrect
# these confidence intervals and variances will be deceptively small-
# if this analysis properly accounted for the complex sampling design,
# you would expect larger standard errors, and therefore fewer significant differences.

# many of the technical documents include a nationwide "Estimated Error" statistic
# intended to act as a crude standard error for _all_ statistics within the country for that wave
# however, this is also a poor proxy for a correctly-implemented complex sample adjustment


# jaime diez-medrano, the director of the wvsa archive
# has recommended to the scientific advisory committee
# unfortunately, this change has not yet been made.

# it should be.  it costs nothing.
# countries that run the survey already have this microdata.


# if you would like to be able to correctly calculate
# confidence intervals with wvs data, please send a polite e-mail
# requesting that countries submit their sample design/cluster variables
# in the future and also for all historical data sets.

# this request should go to the scientific advisory committee
# http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp?CMSID=SAC
# as well as the president, secretariat, and wvsa archive director
