# The data may be different because the first link is from the FBI UCR Programâ€™s NIBRS publication which is a snapshot in time.
# For example, the 2012 deadline for data to be included in the CIUS publication would have been in March 2013.
# The states/agencies had until the end of 2013 to submit additional data and make adjustments before the master closed early in 2014.   


# from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data, ICPSR helpdesk - nacjd@icpsr.umich.edu
# One possibility for the numbers not tying out exactly is whether the FBI counts all the agencies in the data.
# For UCR data tables the FBI sometimes only counts agencies that reported for the entire 12 months.
# I would look to see if your counts are larger than the FBI's, and I'd see if the number of agencies you are using is different from the FBI.
# Another possibility is that the FBI can update their data at any time, and we are not always made aware of that.
