# you *must* visit this university of michigan's inter-university consortium for political and social research
# website and register for a username and password, then click the link in the e-mail
# to activate your account before running this massive download automation program

# this is to protect both yourself and the respondents of the study.  register here:
# https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/newacct
# by registering, you are agreeing to the conditions of use on that page

# once you have registered, place your username and password in the script below.
# this script will not run until a valid username and password are included in the two lines below.
# and make sure you uncomment those two lines by removing the `#`s as well

# your.username <- 'your@login.com'
# your.password <- 'yourpassword'

# this download automation script will not work without the above lines filled in.
# if the your.username and your.password lines above are not filled in with the details you provided at registration, 
# the script is going to break.  to repeat.  register to access nibrs data.

# even if you're only downloading a single extract and you've got a fast internet connection,

# leave it running on friday afternoon (or even better: before you leave for a weeklong vacation).
# depending on your internet and processor speeds, the entire script should take between two and ten days.
# it's running.  don't believe me?  check the working directory (set below) for a new r data file (.rda) every few hours.
