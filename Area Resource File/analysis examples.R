# set your working directory.
# the ARF 2015-2016 data files should have been stored here
# after running the program described above
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# setwd( "C:/My Directory/ARF/" )
# ..in order to set your current working directory


# load the 2015-2016 ARF data file
load( "arf2015.rda" )


# now the 'arf' data frame is available in memory..
# ..but has far too many variables to browse through
ncol( arf )


# the "AHRF 2015-2016 Technical Documentation.xls" file in the current working directory contains field labels
# so create a smaller data table with only a few columns of interest
# first, create a character vector containing only the columns you'll need:
variables.to.keep <-
	c(
		"f00002" ,			# fips state + county code
		"f00008" , 			# state name
		"f12424" , 			# state abbreviation
		"f00010" , 			# county name
		"f13156" , 			# ssa beneficiary county code
		"f0453010" ,		# 2010 census population
		"f1212910"	 		# total active m.d.s non-federal & federal
	)

	
# now create a new data frame 'arf.sub' containing only those specified columns from the 'arf' data frame
arf.sub <- arf[ , variables.to.keep ]


# finally, look at the first six records to browse what the new (manageable) data frame looks like
head( arf.sub )


# rename the variables something more user-friendly
names( arf.sub ) <- c( "fips" , "state" , "stateab" , "county" , "ssa" , "pop2010" , "md2010" )

# and re-examine the first six records
head( arf.sub )


# run some simple summary statistics

# in 2010, the census recorded a total us population of..
sum( arf.sub$pop2010 , na.rm = TRUE )

# in 2010, the american medical association masterfile recorded this many active doctors..
sum( arf.sub$md2010 , na.rm = TRUE )


# when merging the arf to another data set,
# be cautious about using fips vs. ssa county codes

# the entire arf contains...records
nrow( arf.sub )

# there are...unique fips county codes (so one unique fips per record)
length( unique( arf.sub$fips ) )

# but there are fewer unique ssa county codes
length( unique( arf.sub$ssa ) )

# because many counties with fips codes do not have ssa county codes
# here's a few records where the ssa county code equals zero (missing)
head( arf.sub[ arf.sub$ssa == '' , ] )


# you could print all of them to the screen
arf.sub[ arf.sub$ssa == '' , ]
# ..and find they're mostly the us territories.
# because territories have fips but not ssa county codes

# county analysis example #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# goal: look at the ten most populous counties in the united states #

# order the condensed arf by population
arf.sub <- arf.sub[ order( arf.sub$pop2010 , decreasing = TRUE ) , ]
# view http://www.screenr.com/0a28 to learn why the above statement works

# print the first ten records of the newly-ordered data frame

# merge example #
# # # # # # # # #

# goal: merge the arf onto another R data frame #

# as an example, i'll initiate a data frame that contains fake data (presented here as 'fakedata')
# but you'll have to load another R data frame into R
# with either a 'fips' or 'ssa' identifier in order for this merge to work
# the website http://twotorials.com/ has plenty of examples showing how to import your own data

# create a fake data table containing four counties
fakedata <-
	data.frame( 
		# column one will contain the four counties' fips (federal information processing standard) codes
		fips = c( 54005 , 26113 , 31097 , 47053 ) ,
		# column two will contain the four counties' ssa (social security adminstration) codes
		ssa = c( 51020 , 23560 , 28480 , 44260 ) ,
		# column three will contain how cool each county is, on a scale of 0-100
		coolness.factor = c( 0 , 33 , 67 , 100 ) ,
		# column four will contain how many neon signs each county has, per person
		neon.signs.per.capita = c( 10 , 7 , 3 , 0 ) 
	)

# to merge the arf onto fakedata using the county fips code,
# a simple merge should suffice, so long as every fips code has a match
# count the number of records in fakedata
nrow( fakedata )
# perform the merge
fakedata <- merge( fakedata , arf.sub , by = "fips" )
# confirm the number of records in fakedata hasn't changed
nrow( fakedata )


# if some of the records in fakedata do not include valid fips codes,
# but you do not want them thrown out when no matching fips is found in arf.sub..
# count the number of records in fakedata
nrow( fakedata )
# perform the merge - this time with all.x = TRUE - to conduct a left join
# a left join keeps all records in the first data set ('fakedata' in this example)
# regardless of whether a matching fips code was found in the second data frame ('arf.sub')
fakedata <- merge( fakedata , arf.sub , by = "fips" , all.x = TRUE )
# confirm the number of records in fakedata hasn't changed
nrow( fakedata )


# to merge the arf onto fakedata using the county ssa code,
# try limiting the arf to only records with a non-zero ssa code
arf.with.ssa <- subset( arf.sub , ssa != '' )
# count the number of records in fakedata
nrow( fakedata )
# perform the merge
fakedata <- merge( fakedata , arf.with.ssa , by = "ssa" )
# confirm the number of records in fakedata hasn't changed
