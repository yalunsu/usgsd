# you *must* visit this national cancer institute website and agree to their terms
# in order to receive a username and password (a few days later)
# https://seer.cancer.gov/seertrack/data/request/

# once they've e-mailed you a login and password,
# fill them in below, and the download script will work

# if the your.username and your.password lines above are not filled in,
# the script is going to break.  to repeat.  you must fill in a form to access seer data.
