# http://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/TextData.cd1973-2011counts.pdf
dbGetQuery( db , 'select tablename , count(*) from x group by tablename' )

# note that 
# 'select tablename , count(*) from x group by tablename'
# in the above `dbGetQuery` function is just a sql command.
# if you don't know sql, you should beeline to the nearest sql tutorial website
# and get learnin' because it's terribly powerful and blazingly fast
# w3schools has a good intro.  http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp


# instead of printing results to the screen, you might want to
# store everything into a new `counts.by.table` object..
counts.by.table <- dbGetQuery( db , 'select tablename , count(*) from x group by tablename' )
# ..which is a data.frame object
class( counts.by.table )


# that you can print..
counts.by.table

# or save as an r object
# save( counts.by.table , file = "C:/My Directory/counts by table.rda" )

# or export to a comma separated value (.csv) file
# write.csv( counts.by.table , file = "C:/My Directory/counts by table.csv" )

# ..or really do just about whatever you like with.  hey, it's just another table
# maybe check out http://twotorials.com/ to see what other
# exciting things you can do with data.frame objects in the r language
