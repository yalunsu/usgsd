# the `unique.designations` and `y` objects below are data tables with one-record-per-hpsa
# as opposed to the table `x` - which contains one-record-per-geography
# in order to match the nationwide published statistics, simply use these one-record-per-hpsa tables
# however, to merge hpsa data up with specific geographies and locations, you'll need to use the one-record-per-geography tables

# match the hrsa-published 'practitioners needed to remove designations' column

# the quants at the health services and resources administration threw a curveball here:
# every hpsa with a shortage ending with 0.5 should round *up*
# r does not round up by default, it rounds to the nearest even number.
# if you'd like a nerdlaugh, check out this discussion:
# https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2009-March/190119.html

# initiate a rounding function that always rounds *up* when the number ends with 0.5
