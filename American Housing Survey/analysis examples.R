# in a database (.db) on the local machine. running the download all microdata script will create both. #

# at this point, you have a replicate-weighted,
# complex sample survey design object
ahs.design
# for most analysis commands, it doesn't matter whether it's backed by a sqlite database or not.
# it only makes a difference on processing time and whether your computer's memory overloads.
# so, regardless of which of the two above options you chose,
# you can now start having fun with these
