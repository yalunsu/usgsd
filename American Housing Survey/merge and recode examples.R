# note regarding merging and recoding: recodes in an individual american housing survey file  #
# can happen on any individual table at any time, so long as you complete all recodes before  #
# constructing the survey design object (in other words, before running the function called   #
# `svrepdesign` -- however merges require much more care.  the census bureau creates a        #
# "flat file" containing one-record-per-housing-unit (think of that like a consolidated file) #
# however rather than replicating that one-size-fits-all consolidated file creation, you'll   #
# have to reshape and merge on the columns you need by yourself.  consider the `tnewhouse`    #
# file your "starting point" and merge other information (usually by the `control` column) on #
# to that file.  but be careful when you do!  the other files contain multiple records per    #
# household or zero records per household (or both), so be sure to use LEFT JOIN if you're    #
# using SQL or all.x = TRUE if you're using r's merge function.  if you're new to merges,     #
# watch http://www.screenr.com/Znd8.  oh yeah one more thing: why is `tnewhouse` the main     #
# analytic file?  because it's the only file that contains the generalizable survey weights!  #
# you *cannot* use the american housing survey to make estimates of the us population.  your  #
# results generalize to the us housing supply (both inhabited and uninhabited).  the whole    #
# point of survey research is to _generalize_ about some broader population, so if you don't  #
# have weights that are representative of the thing you're trying to talk about, you're sol.  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# note regarding sql commands and alternatives: the recodes below use basic commands from sql #
# this is necessary for computers with limited resources, since none of the data requires ram #
# but if you've got a more powerful computer and feel more at-ease with r than with sql code  #
# you can stick with the second set of examples (non-database-backed). just be mindful of ram #

# how to edit, merge, and create a survey design inside a sqlite database #
###########################################################################

# this version is more complicated but requires a less powerful computer.

##############################################################
# step 1: connect to the ahs data table you'd like to recode # 
# then make a copy so you don't lose the pristine original.  #

# the command 
db <- dbConnect( SQLite() , ahs.dbname )
# connects the current instance of r to the sqlite database

# now simply copy you'd like to recode into a new table
dbSendQuery( db , "CREATE TABLE recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 AS SELECT * FROM tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14" )
# this action protects the original 'tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' table from any accidental errors.
# at any point, we can delete this recoded copy of the data table using the command..
# dbRemoveTable( db , "recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14" )
# ..and start fresh by re-copying the pristine file from tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14



############################################
# step 2: make all of your recodes at once #

# from this point forward, all commands will only touch the
# 'recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' table.  the 'tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' is now off-limits.

# add a new column.  call it, oh i don't know, adult?
# since it's actually a categorical variable, make it VARCHAR( 255 )
dbSendQuery( db , "ALTER TABLE recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 ADD COLUMN adult VARCHAR( 255 )" )

# if you wanted to create a numeric variable, substitute VARCHAR( 255 ) with DOUBLE PRECISION like this:
# dbSendQuery( db , "ALTER TABLE recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 ADD COLUMN adultx DOUBLE PRECISION" )
# ..but then use `SET adult = 1` and `SET adult = 0` instead of 'yes' and 'no' as shown below

# by hand, you could set the values of the adult column
dbSendQuery( db , "UPDATE recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 SET adult = 'yes' WHERE age >= 18" )
dbSendQuery( db , "UPDATE recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 SET adult = 'no' WHERE age < 18" )


# quickly check your work by running a simple SELECT COUNT(*) command with sql
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT adult , age , COUNT(*) as number_of_records from recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 GROUP BY adult , age ORDER BY age" )
# and notice that each value of age has been deposited in the appropriate age category



################################################################################################
# step 3: create a one-record-per-`control` table to be merged onto tnewhouse_trepwgt_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 #

# if you are unclear on why this is critical, re-read "note regarding merging and recoding" above

# create a new table in the database called `aggregated_tperson`
# with five columns:
	# unique household identifier
	# number of persons in the house
	# percent of persons in the house who are adults
	# number of adults in the household
	# sum of household salaries, with negatives bumped up to zeroes
dbSendQuery( 
	db , 
	"CREATE TABLE aggregated_tperson AS
	SELECT 
		control , 
		count(*) as num_persons , 
		avg( adult = 'yes' ) as pct_adults , 
		sum( age >= 18 ) as num_adults ,
		sum( CASE WHEN sal < 0 THEN 0 ELSE sal END ) as total_household_salaries
	FROM recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14
	GROUP BY control"
)

# at this point, you're finished with the `recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14` table,
# so it can be stricken from the record if you like.
dbRemoveTable( db , 'recoded_tperson_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' )

# sidenote: this newly-aggregated table on its own is pretty small
# you can probably read it into ram by itself and have a look
x <- dbReadTable( db , 'aggregated_tperson' )

# check out the first..
head( x )
# ..and last six records
tail( x )


# but this table has fewer records than the table you'll be merging it onto.
dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT count(*) FROM aggregated_tperson' )
dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT count(*) FROM tnewhouse_trepwgt_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' )
# that's because not every household has people in it!		


#######################################
# step 4: left join that little puppy #

# time for a left join.  are you ready for a left join?
dbSendQuery( 
	db , 
	"CREATE TABLE merged_2011 AS 
	SELECT * 
	FROM tnewhouse_trepwgt_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14 AS a 
	LEFT JOIN aggregated_tperson AS b
	ON a.control = b.control"
)
# not so bad.
# keep all records in the lefthand table
# regardless of a match in the righthand table.

# so now when you look at the record counts..
dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT count(*) FROM aggregated_tperson' )
dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT count(*) FROM tnewhouse_trepwgt_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14' )
dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT count(*) FROM merged_2011' )
# the `merged_2011` table should match the `tnewhouse_trepwgt_2011_nationalandmetropolitanv14` table.

# remember to clean up your toys.
# here's how to erase the `aggregated_tperson` table
dbRemoveTable( db , 'aggregated_tperson' )

# oh!  and i think you want to recode a few more things in your newly-created table.
# if there were no persons in the household,
# the left join will have made the `num_persons` and `num_adults` fields missing.
# those should probably switch to zeroes, don't you think?
dbSendQuery( db , "UPDATE merged_2011 SET num_adults = 0 WHERE num_adults IS NULL" )
dbSendQuery( db , "UPDATE merged_2011 SET num_persons = 0 WHERE num_persons IS NULL" )
# on the other hand, `pct_adults` and `total_household_salaries` should stay missing.
# at least, that's what i would do.
