# which has four digits: the first digit is whether the age is stored in years/months/days
# the last three digits are the actually age (in years/months/days)

# so after excluding all of the `9999` values, "age in years" can be computed with
# dbSendQuery( db , "ALTER TABLE mortality_us_2010 ADD COLUMN age_in_years DOUBLE PRECISION" )
# according to the 2010 codebook, anyone with a first digit between 2 and 8 died before age 1

# merge the population by age category with the deaths by age category
y <- merge( pbac , dbac )

# then merge _that_ with the census 2000 population weights
z <- merge( y , pop2k )

# divide the number of deaths by the total population within each age strata
z$rate.within.age <- z$count / z$pop
# which essentially gives a crude death rate within each age strata
