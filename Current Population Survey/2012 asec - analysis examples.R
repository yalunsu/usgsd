# important note about the current population survey: interviews are conducted in march #
# about experiences during the previous year.  therefore, the census bureau's 2012 file #
# includes information (income, work experience, health insurance) pertaining to 2011   #
# whenever you use the current population survey to talk about america, subract a year. #
