# local machine. running the download, import, and design script will create a monetdb-backed multiply-imputed database with whatcha need             #

# the program for international student assessment download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2012 student questionnaire tables

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.

# load the desired program for international student assessment monet database-backed complex sample design objects

# uncomment one this line by removing the `#` at the front..
load( '2012 int_stu12_dec03.rda' )	# analyze the 2012 student questionnaire

# connect the complex sample designs to the monet database #

# for the most part, `this_design` can be used like a hybrid multiply-imputed, database-backed svrepdesign object.

################################################

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in pisa #

# since the pisa gets loaded as a monet database-backed survey object instead of a data frame,
# the number of unweighted records cannot be calculated by running the nrow() function on a data frame.

# running the nrow() function on the database connection object
# simply produces an error..
# nrow( db )

# because the monet database might contain multiple data tables
class( db )


# instead, perform the same unweighted count directly from one of the sql tables
# stored inside the monet database on your hard disk (as opposed to RAM)
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_records FROM int_stu12_dec03_imp1" )

	

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in pisa #
# broken out by country #

# note: this is easiest by simply running a sql query on the monet database directly
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT cnt , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM int_stu12_dec03_imp1 GROUP BY cnt" )



# count the weighted number of students *worldwide* that pisa data represents #
MIcombine( with( this_design , svytotal( ~one ) ) )

# note that this is exactly equivalent to summing up the weight variable
# from the original database (.db) file connection
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT SUM( one ) AS sum_weights FROM int_stu12_dec03_imp1" )
# but only because `one` has the same value across all five implicates


# weighted country population, for all countries in the data set
# by country
MIcombine( with( this_design , svyby( ~one , ~cnt , svytotal ) ) )


# calculate the mean of a linear variable #

# average science score - across all individuals in the data set
MIcombine( with( this_design , svymean( ~scie ) ) )

# by country
MIcombine( with( this_design , svyby( ~scie , ~cnt , svymean ) ) )
