# open the survey design object's connection

# for the most part, `pisa.imp` can be used like a hybrid multiply-imputed, sqlrepsurvey object.


# print the overall reading score for all students in the entire data set.

# note that this includes non-oecd countries, so it doesn't match the oecd's powerpoint slide
MIcombine( with( pisa.imp , svymean( ~readz ) ) )


##########################################
# okay time to start replicating numbers #
##########################################


# on slide number two, take a look at the "total oecd" row's mean and standard error
# (first column with statistics)

# break out `pisa.imp` by oecd- and non-oecd students.
MIcombine( with( pisa.imp , svyby( ~readz , ~oecd , svymean ) ) )
# boom!  matches precisely.


# subset `pisa.imp` like you'd subset any other survey object.
oecd.imp <- subset( pisa.imp , oecd == 1 )
# now you've got an `oecd.imp` object restricted to only oecd students

# re-run the mean and standard error of the reading score,
# this time using the monetdb-backed object that's been subsetted already..
MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svymean( ~readz ) ) )
# ..and it exactly matches again, hooray!

# break out the oecd students' reading scores by gender
MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svyby( ~readz , ~st04q01 , svymean ) ) )
# exactly match.  nice.

# let's run that same command as above, but store the results into a `oecd.boygirl` object
oecd.boygirl <- MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svyby( ~readz , ~st04q01 , svymean ) ) )

# now the `survey` package's `svycontrast` function can be used.
# note oecd.boygirl has two levels: 1, and 2.
# boys are first, and we want to compare them to girls, so make them negative one
# and girls (the second level) a positive one.  again, that's (zero, negative one, positive one)
# put it into the diff= position inside a list in the second position of `svycontrast`
svycontrast( oecd.boygirl , list( diff = c( -1 , 1 ) ) )
# and boo-yah, you have just replicated the powerpoint slide's difference boy minus girl and also standard error.

# was that too much for you?  if you've only got two levels,
# just use this custom function i've written *just for you*
# that performs a simple t-test on monetdb-backed, multiply-imputed designs
pisa.svyttest( readz ~ st04q01 , oecd.imp )
# see?
# same difference.



#################
# quantile time #

# hey how about we run the reading score for each of those quantiles.
MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svyby( ~readz , ~one , svyquantile , c( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.75 , 0.9 , 0.95 ) ) ) )


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# quantile standard error difference explanation  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# standard error computation for quantiles of very large data sets requires an element of randomness
# therefore, these SEs will not precisely match the official recommendations.  but there's no theoretical basis
# that one answer is better than another.

# from the oecd's recommended sas scripts - http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2006/42628103.zip
# notice the random numbers used in their quantile calculations?  the normal() function in sas injects some randomness in the result.

# DATA QUARTILE_TEMP1 (KEEP=&BYVAR &REPLI_ROOT.0-&REPLI_ROOT.80 &PV_ROOT.1-&PV_ROOT.5 INDEX1-INDEX5 &ID_SCHOOL &INDEX NB_MISS) ;
	# SET &INFILE;
	# NB_MISS=0;
	# ARRAY A (6) &INDEX &PV_ROOT.1-&PV_ROOT.5;
	# DO I=1 TO 6;
		# IF (A(I) IN (.,.M,.N,.I)) THEN NB_MISS=NB_MISS+1;
	# END;
	# INDEX1=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-01));
	# INDEX2=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-23));
	# INDEX3=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-45));
	# INDEX4=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-67));
	# INDEX5=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-89));
# RUN;

# so yeah, there's no way that r + monetdb can precisely match sas.  but who cares.  both results are defensible.

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# end of quantile standard error difference explanation #

# alright.  let's move a little faster now.
