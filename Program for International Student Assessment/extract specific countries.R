# prior to running this analysis script, the pisa 2009 multiply-imputed tables must be loaded as a monet-backed survey object on the                  #
# local machine. running the download, import, and design script will create a monetdb-backed multiply-imputed database with whatcha need             #

# the program for international student assessment download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2009 student questionnaire tables

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.

# `brazil.2009.design` is a multiply-imputed (but no longer monetdb-backed) replicate-weighted survey design object
# that you can analyze using syntax similar to the national health interview survey's multiply-imputed survey objects (found here)
# https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/blob/master/National%20Health%20Interview%20Survey/2011%20personsx%20plus%20samadult%20with%20multiple%20imputation%20-%20analyze.R
# or the consumer expenditure survey's multiply-imputed survey objects (found here)
# https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/blob/master/Consumer%20Expenditure%20Survey/2011%20fmly%20intrvw%20-%20analysis%20examples.R

# this pisa extraction script does not contain a full set of analysis examples for this non-monetdb-backed object
# but you can review syntax examples for multiply-imputed objects in those other scripts.  please and thank you.
