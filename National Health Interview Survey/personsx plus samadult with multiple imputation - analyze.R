#####################################
# merge personsx and samadult files #
#####################################

# note: the logical steps taken here could also be applied to 
# merging the personsx and samchild files

# the personsx and samadult files are both at the individual or person-level
# (as opposed to family-level or household-level)
# so merging them together will require three variables:
# hhx (household unique identifier)
# fmx (family unique identifier)
# fpx (person unique identifier)

# store the names of these three columns in a character vector
merge.vars <- c( "hhx" , "fmx" , "fpx" )

# these two files have multiple overlapping (redundant) columns,
# so determine which columns are included in both data frames
# at the same time, enclose this statement in () thereby printing the vector to the screen
( columns.in.both.dfs <- intersect( names( sa ) , names( x ) ) )


# since the merge.vars will be used to merge the two data frames,
# those three variables should be excluded from the list of redundant columns
# keep all column names that don't match the merge variables
# at the same time, enclose this statement in () thereby printing the vector to the screen
( redundant.columns <- columns.in.both.dfs[ !( columns.in.both.dfs %in% merge.vars ) ] )

# notice that the three merge.vars have disappeared


# most analyses start with the personsx file,
# so shave the redundant columns off of the samadult file
# keep all columns in the samadult file that are not in the redundant.columns vector
sa <- sa[ , !( names( sa ) %in% redundant.columns ) ]


# at this point, the only overlap between the personsx and samadult files
# should be the three merge.vars
# throw an error if that's not true
stopifnot( merge.vars == intersect( names( sa ) , names( x ) ) )


# remember that the samadult file contains a subset of the individuals in personsx
# therefore, an inner join of the two should have the same number of records as samadult

# perform the actual merge
x.sa <- merge( x , sa )
# note that the merge() function merges using all intersecting columns -

# uncomment this line to see intersecting columns
# intersect( names( sa ) , names( x ) )

# - by default, the 'by' parameter does not need to be specified
# for more detail about the merge function, type ?merge in the console

# throw an error if the number of records in the merged file
# does not match the number of records in the samadult file
stopifnot( nrow( x.sa ) == nrow( sa ) )


# now the x.sa data frame contains all of the rows in the samadult file and 
# all columns from both the samadult and personsx files
# therefore, there's no more need for the samadult file on its own
# so delete the samadult file
rm( sa )

# and clear up RAM
gc()


# at this point, taylor-series linearization survey objects can be created
# so long as the analysis does not involve the imputed income variables
