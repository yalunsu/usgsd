##########################################################################


# set your working directory.
# the NHIS 2011 personsx data file should have been
# stored in a year-specific directory within this folder.
# so if the file "personsx.rda" exists in the directory "C:/My Directory/NHIS/2011/" 
# then the working directory should be set to "C:/My Directory/NHIS/"
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# setwd( "C:/My Directory/NHIS/" )
# ..in order to set your current working directory


# remove the # in order to run this install.packages line only once
# install.packages( "survey" )

library(survey) # load survey package (analyzes complex design surveys)


# set R to produce conservative standard errors instead of crashing
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/exmample-lonely.html
options( survey.lonely.psu = "adjust" )
# this setting matches the MISSUNIT option in SUDAAN


# choose what year of data to analyze
# note: this can be changed to any year that has already been downloaded locally
# by the "1963-2011 - download all microdata.R" program above
year <- 2011


# construct the filepath (within the current working directory) to the personsx.rda file
path.to.rda.file <- paste( getwd() , year , "personsx.rda" , sep = "/" )

# print that filepath to the screen
print( path.to.rda.file )


# now the "NHIS.11.personsx.df" data frame can be loaded directly
# from your local hard drive.  this is much faster.
load( path.to.rda.file )


# construct a string containing the data frame name of the personsx data table
# stored within the R data file (.rda)
# note: for 2011, this data frame will be named "NHIS.11.personsx.df"
# but constructing it dynamically will allow analyses of other years
# by simply changing the 'year' variable above
df.name <- paste( "NHIS" , substr( year , 3 , 4 ) , "personsx" , "df" , sep = "." )

# copy the personsx data frame to the variable x for easier analyses
# (because NHIS.11.personsx.df is unwieldy to keep typing)
x <- get( df.name )

# remove the original copy of the data frame from memory
rm( list = df.name )

# clear up RAM
