################################################

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in acs #

# simply use the nrow function..

# name the database files in the "MonetDB" folder of the current working directory
dbfolder <- paste0( getwd() , "/MonetDB" )

# stored inside the monet database on your hard disk (as opposed to RAM)
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_records FROM acs2011_1yr_m" )

	

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in acs #
# broken out by state #

# note: this is easiest by simply running a sql query on the monet database directly
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT st , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM acs2011_1yr_m GROUP BY st" )



# count the weighted number of individuals in acs #

# the population of the united states (including group quarters residents: both institionalized and non-institutionalized) #

# by state

# subsetting example #
######################

# restrict the acs.m object to females only
acs.m.female <- subset( acs.m , sex == 2 )

# now any of the above commands can be re-run
# using the acs.m.female object
# instead of the acs.m object
# in order to analyze females only
	
# calculate the mean of a linear variable #

# average age - nationwide, restricted to females
svymean( ~agep , acs.m.female )

# median age - nationwide, restricted to females
svyquantile( ~agep , acs.m.female , 0.5 )
