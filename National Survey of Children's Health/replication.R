# for machines with 4gb or less, it's necessary to subset the five implicate data frames to contain only
# the columns necessary for your particular analysis.  if running the code below generates a memory-related error,
# simply uncomment these lines and re-run the program:


# define which variables from the five imputed iterations to keep
vars.to.keep <- c( 'one' , 'povlevel_i' , 'state' , 'sample' , 'nschwt' , 'k6q40' , 'k7q05r' , 'k7q30' , 'k7q31' , 'k7q32' )
# note: this throws out all other variables
# so if you need additional columns for your analysis,
# add them to the `vars.to.keep` vector above


# restrict each `imp#` data frame to only those variables
imp1 <- imp1[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp2 <- imp2[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp3 <- imp3[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp4 <- imp4[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp5 <- imp5[ , vars.to.keep ]


# clear up RAM
gc()

# that includes the five data tables - imp1 through imp5
nsch.design <-

# this is the methodologically-correct way to analyze the national survey of children's health
# main disadvantage: requires code that's less intuitive for analysts familiar with 
# the r survey package's svymean( ~formula , design ) layout

nsch.design

# ..or querying attributes directly.  not much yet.

# `nsch.design` is a weird critter.  it's actually five survey designs, mushed into one thing.
# when you run an analysis on the nsch.design object, you're actually running the same analysis
# on all five survey designs contained in the object -
# and then the MIcombine() function will lumps them all together
# to give you the correct statistics and error terms


# oh hey look at the first (of five) survey designs..

# note the `data alert` text at the bottom of their graph:
# data alert: household poverty level for the 9.3% of households in the sample with unknown values for income, household size, or both, was calculated using single imputation methods. the poverty level estimates and confidence intervals based on single imputed poverty 

# basically, this means they're not using the methods that they recommend.

# indicator 5.3: did child participate in one or more organized activities outside school?
# (see http://www.childhealthdata.org/browse/survey/results?q=2518&r=1 for published results.)
