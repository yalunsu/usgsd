# memory conservation step #

# for machines with 4gb or less, it's necessary to subset the five implicate data frames to contain only
# the columns necessary for your particular analysis.  if running the code below generates a memory-related error,
# simply uncomment these lines and re-run the program:


# define which variables from the five imputed iterations to keep
vars.to.keep <- c( 'one' , 'povlevel_i' , 'state' , 'sample' , 'nschwt' , 'ageyr_child' , 'sex' , 'agepos4' )
# note: this throws out all other variables
# so if you need additional columns for your analysis,
# add them to the `vars.to.keep` vector above


# restrict each `imp#` data frame to only those variables
imp1 <- imp1[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp2 <- imp2[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp3 <- imp3[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp4 <- imp4[ , vars.to.keep ]
imp5 <- imp5[ , vars.to.keep ]


# clear up RAM
gc()

# end of memory conservation step #


# construct a multiply-imputed survey design object
# that includes the five data tables - imp1 through imp5
nsch.design <- 
	svydesign( 
		
		# do not use a clustering variable
		id = ~ 1 , 
		
		# use both `state` and `sample` columns as the stratification variables

# this is the methodologically-correct way to analyze the national survey of children's health
# main disadvantage: requires code that's less intuitive for analysts familiar with 
# the r survey package's svymean( ~formula , design ) layout


# this object can also be examined by typing the name into the console..
nsch.design

# ..or querying attributes directly.  not much yet.

# `nsch.design` is a weird critter.  it's actually five survey designs, mushed into one thing.
# when you run an analysis on the nsch.design object, you're actually running the same analysis
# on all five survey designs contained in the object -
# and then the MIcombine() function will lumps them all together
# to give you the correct statistics and error terms


# oh hey look at the first (of five) survey designs..
nsch.design$designs[[1]]

# ..and here's the first design's attributes,
# which look more like a standard svydesign() object
