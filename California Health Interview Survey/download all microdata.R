# you *must* visit ucla's website and register for a username and password, then 
# download a single year of microdata manually from their website
loginpage <- "http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/pages/login.aspx"
# to activate your account before running this massive download automation program


# once you have registered and downloaded any year of data, place your username and password in the script below.
# this script will not run until a valid username and password are included in the two lines below.
# and make sure you uncomment those two lines by removing the `#`s as well

# your_username <- 'yourusername'
# your_password <- 'yourpassword'

# this download automation script will not work without the above lines filled in.
# if the your_username and your_password lines above are not filled in with the details you provided at registration, 
# the script is going to break.  to repeat.  register to access chis data.
