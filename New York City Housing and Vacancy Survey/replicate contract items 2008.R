##########################################################################################

# the statistics (means, medians, sums, totals, percentiles, distributions) shown using the method below are correct.
# the errors (standard errors, standard deviations, variances, confidence intervals, significance tests) are not.
# they are (at least after lots of testing) _always_ too big, meaning that if you find a statistically significant difference
# with the code below, it would also be statistically significant according to the census bureau.  on the other hand,
# the census bureau might occasionally find statistically significant differences where the code below won't detect any difference.
# in other words, the method shown below will come up with too many _false negatives_ but never a _false positive_.

# to calculate error terms / confidence intervals the census-approved way, the only current option is to follow this
# hellishly-cumbersome document where you have to multiply stuff by hand and calculate SEs for each and every statistic.
# it. is. a. nightmare.  also, note that there's a new document every year.  here:
# http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/data/2008/S&A_2008.pdf

# case and point: if you want to automate the calculation of error terms (or if you don't care about error terms),
# just use the back-of-the-envelope method shown below.


# a more in-depth discussion #

# the census bureau does not release one of the clustering variables - `segment` -
# due to geo-coding and confidentiality concerns, so it is impossible to re-construct
# a taylor-series linearization R survey object design that will match the census bureau CIs
# in the excel file above exactly.  for further discussion of this, take a look at this e-mail from NYCHVS administrators
# https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/tree/master/New%20York%20City%20Housing%20and%20Vacancy%20Survey/the%20census%20bureau%20and%20the%20impossible%20to%20reproduce%20SEs.pdf?raw=TRUE

# at this point, using svymean, svyquantile, svytotal and all other functions listed on
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/
# will result in confidence intervals and standard errors that are *too small* - that is, false positives.

# to get only false negatives, simply multiply the standard errors by *two*
# or (this is exactly equivalent) multiply the variance by four.


# ready to start reproducing excel column D from this document?
# http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/data/2008/contract_items_2008.xls


# calculate the overall occupied housing units
a <- svytotal( ~one , y )
# here's cell D9
coef( a )

# multiply the variance by four
attr( a , 'var' ) <- attr( a , 'var' ) * 4

# our statistic has not changed..
coef( a )
# ..but now the standard error will be doubled.
# here's the widened +/- 90% confidence interval
SE( a ) * qnorm( 0.95 )
# remember, this will be slightly larger than cell E9 in every case
# so you'll get some false negatives.  for more detail, look up
# the epidemiological terms `sensitivity` and `specificity`
# this test is not sensitive enough, but it is specific.  ;)

# or print the confidence interval directly
confint( a , level = 0.9 )


# calculate the statistics shown in D14 - D22..
a <- svytotal( ~strclass , y , na.rm = TRUE )
# ..still calculating the modified (widened) SE
attr( a , 'var' ) <- attr( a , 'var' ) * 4

coef( a )
SE( a ) * qnorm( 0.95 )
confint( a , level = 0.9 )


# calculate the statistics shown in D26 - D27..
a <- svytotal( ~owners , y , na.rm = TRUE )
# ..still calculating the modified (widened) SE
attr( a , 'var' ) <- attr( a , 'var' ) * 4

coef( a )
SE( a ) * qnorm( 0.95 )
confint( a , level = 0.9 )


# calculate the statistics shown in D31 - D101..
a <- svyby( ~one , ~ subboro + borough , y , svytotal )

# now for `svyby` commands, note the difference in this off-the-cuff modification #

# instead of modifying the variance attribute,
# simply multiply the standard error by two.
a$se <- a$se * 2


coef( a )
SE( a ) * qnorm( 0.95 )
confint( a , level = 0.9 )


# yeah.  i get that this method isn't terribly desirable.
# but your choices are:
# a) follow the generalized variance formula: http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/data/2008/S&A_2008.pdf
# b) pay the census bureau for custom crosstabs
# c) do it my way.
# best of luck to you  ;)
