##########################################################################################

# the statistics (means, medians, sums, totals, percentiles, distributions) shown using the method below are correct.
# the errors (standard errors, standard deviations, variances, confidence intervals, significance tests) are not.
# they are (at least after lots of testing) _always_ too big, meaning that if you find a statistically significant difference
# with the code below, it would also be statistically significant according to the census bureau.  on the other hand,
# the census bureau might occasionally find statistically significant differences where the code below won't detect any difference.
# in other words, the method shown below will come up with too many _false negatives_ but never a _false positive_.

# to calculate error terms / confidence intervals the census-approved way, the only current option is to follow this
# hellishly-cumbersome document where you have to multiply stuff by hand and calculate SEs for each and every statistic.
# it. is. a. nightmare.  also, note that there's a new document every year.  here:
# http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/data/2008/S&A_2008.pdf

# case and point: if you want to automate the calculation of error terms (or if you don't care about error terms),
# just use the back-of-the-envelope method shown below.


# a more in-depth discussion #

# the census bureau does not release one of the clustering variables - `segment` -
# due to geo-coding and confidentiality concerns, so it is impossible to re-construct
# a taylor-series linearization R survey object design that will match the census bureau CIs
# in the excel file above exactly.  for further discussion of this, take a look at this e-mail from NYCHVS administrators
