# taylor series linearization (tsl) version #

# this script uses the tsl method to calculate standard errors
# tsl has the advantage of being computationally easier
# and the disadvantage of not producing standard errors or confidence intervals
# on percentile statistics
# (for example, tsl cannot compute the confidence interval around a median)

# if you are not sure which method to use, use the brr script instead of tsl
# available in the same folder


# the statistics (means, medians, percents, and counts) from brr and tsl designs
# will match exactly.  the standard errors and confidence intervals
# will be slightly different. both methods are considered valid.
