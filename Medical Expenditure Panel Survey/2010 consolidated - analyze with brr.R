# balanced repeated replication (brr) version #

# this script uses the brr method to calculate standard errors
# brr has the disadvantage of being computationally more difficult
# and the advantage of producing standard errors or confidence intervals
# on percentile statistics
# (for example, tsl cannot compute the confidence interval around a median)

# if you are not sure which method to use, use this brr script instead of tsl
# available in the same folder


# the statistics (means, medians, percents, and counts) from brr and tsl designs
# will match exactly.  the standard errors and confidence intervals
# will be slightly different. both methods are considered valid.
