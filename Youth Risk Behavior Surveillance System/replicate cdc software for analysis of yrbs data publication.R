# warning: the syntax presented from this point forward should not be used for your analysis. please. the code below exactly matches the STATA  #
# output published by the CDC, but i only perform this exercise to prove understanding this complex sample survey data set, and not really as   #
# an analysis example.  replicating STATA precisely requires the creation of a new survey design object for every single statistic, which is    #
# unwieldy and kind of unnecessary.  instead of starting your analysis from the code in this file, use please the `analysis examples` syntax at #
