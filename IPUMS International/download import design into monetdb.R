######################################################################################
# download a single year and single country census microdata extract csv file from   #
# the minnesota population center's ipums-international online repository.  prior to #
# working through this guide, you must create a csv-formatted extract through their  #
# online system.  that extract must contain the variables "PERWT" "SERIAL" "STRATA"  #
# otherwise you will not be able to construct a proper complex sample and all your   #
# results will be wrong, whoopsies.  once you have submitted the extract through the #
# ipums-international site and received "IPUMS-International data extract is ready." #
# you can copy and paste the zipped extract's exact url below, along with your login #
######################################################################################


# # uncomment and edit the following three lines of code # #
# username <- 'your_email'
# password <- 'your_password'
# this_extract <- "https://international.ipums.org/international-action/downloads/extract_files/[[your_projectname]]_[[your_extract_number]].csv.gz"
# # uncomment and edit the previous three lines of code # #


# # # # # choose whether to use monetdb or active working memory # # # # #


# # # there are tradeoffs to this processing speed. # # #

# # # strengths:
# # # data set does not need to fit into working active memory
# # # computations run much faster than data loaded into memory
# # # since squeezing data set into active memory does not matter,
# # # -- you can make an ipums extract with every single column just once
# # # -- and never repeat the extract creation/download/import process for that census

# # # weaknesses:
# # # database-backed commands require slightly different syntax for users familiar with survey package
# # # loading takes a long time (but you can go do something else)

# # # if the ipums-international extract files that you need to analyze do not fit into
# # # the active working memory of your available hardware, then you have no choice
# # # and you must use monetdb to analyze ipums-international with R.
# # # but on the other hand, just because you can load your needed extracts into working memory
# # # you might still benefit from using a monetdb-backed survey design.
# # # monetdb-backed designs work much better interactively just because individual analysis commands run faster.  no waiting.

# # # continue using this guide if you have chosen to use monetdb # # #

# # # if you would prefer to load your ipums extract directly into active working memory (ram),
# # # then follow the guide `download import design within memory.R` within this syntax directory instead

# # # manual variable blanking # # #

# unfortunately, there is no easily-accessible missingness indicator within the ipums-international documentation.
# if you would like invalid values to be treated as missings, then you will have to review the ipums variable codebooks manually.
# let's blank out only one variable's missing values by hand:

# # note that this is different from the "in memory" guide, where three variables were blanked.
# # i recommend not blanking out *categorical* variable values in survey designs,
# # because they can trigger finnickyness/bugs.  it is safer to only blank out linear variable missing values.

# https://international.ipums.org/international-action/variables/INCWAGE#codes_section
# INCWAGE = 9999998 is "unknown/missing"
# INCWAGE = 9999999 is "not in universe"

# here's a simple loop construction #

# store one variable that has values to blank into a single character vector
vars_to_blank <- c( 'incwage' )

# one set of values to blank out, nested within a list just like the "in memory" guide
vals_to_blank <- 
	list(

# confirm that you have one variable for each vector of values to blank
if( length( vars_to_blank ) != length( vals_to_blank ) ) stop( "these lengths must be the same." )

# loop through each of the variables to blank..
for ( this_col in seq( vars_to_blank ) ){

	# ..for any column matching one of the values-to-blank, update those particular rows to be NULL instead
	dbSendQuery(

			tablename , 
			"SET" ,
