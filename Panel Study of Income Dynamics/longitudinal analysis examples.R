# note that the tutorials posted on the panel study of income dynamics website are out-of-date.
# the analysis examples below use tutorial #3 as a guide, but to not match those published numbers exactly,
# because since that tutorial was posted, they added a bunch of records and modified a bunch of values.
# even if you limit the data set to the 1,633 matching records (as they suggest), you can see that they've made changes
# in the actual values for some of the records of those remaining 1,633, so your answers still will not match.
# in short: you'll have to trust that my modern version of their tutorials is accurate.

# hope that works for you. if it doesn't, e-mail psidhelp@umich.edu and ask for their tutorials to be updated. ;)
# and yes, tutorial #1 is more current, but it doesn't use the panel.  using the panel is the whole point of this survey.
