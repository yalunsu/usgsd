# set your working directory.
# the ATUS 2006 data files should have been stored here
# after running the program described above
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..

# load the activity-level file

# "care of household children"
# which can be found in page 3 of the 2006 lexicon
# http://www.bls.gov/tus/lexiconnoex2006.pdf#page=3
# tier1 code "care for household members" is "03"
# tier2 codes specific to children are: "01" , "02" , and "03"

childcare.activities <- 
	atusact[ atusact$tutier1code == 3 & atusact$tutier2code %in% 1:3 , ]

# since the table above contains one record per activity
# and you'll need one record per respondent,
# yooouuuuu guessssed it!  it's time to aggregate the current table


# sum up activity duration at the respondent-level
# (using tucaseid as the unique identifier)
# from the childcare activities file
respondent.level.childcare.activities <-

# note that some of the activity duration columns
# contain missings.  these individuals simply did not
# engage in any childcare activities during their interview day
# so instead of including them as missings, their values should
# be overwritten with zeroes.

# for all records in data.frame `x` where the `tuactdur24`
# column is missing, overwrite it with a zero.
x[ is.na( x$tuactdur24 ) , 'tuactdur24' ] <- 0


# now simply use a `weighted.mean` function
weighted.mean( x$tuactdur24 , x$tufinlwgt )

# the average american spent performing childcare activites

# as seen in this bls publication example 1 answer at #
# http://www.bls.gov/tus/atususersguide.pdf#page=71   #

# divide that result by sixty minutes in an hour
weighted.mean( x$tuactdur24 , x$tufinlwgt ) / 60
# to find the average number of hours per day
# the average american spent performing childcare activites
