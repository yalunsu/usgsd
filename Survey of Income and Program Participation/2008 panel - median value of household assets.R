# analysis examples #

# reproduce census published statistics as closely as possible, using the public use files
# http://www.census.gov/people/wealth/files/Wealth_Tables_2010.xls

# note: these results do not match the published results exactly because
# census bureau publications of sipp data use a different file than the publicly-available one,
# which is topcoded, edited, and contains slightly different weights


# the survey design still contains 85,397 records
nrow( z )

# keep only records where the person is the reference person
w <- subset( z , errp %in% 1:2 )

# but now only contains 33,795 records
nrow( w )


# confirm that everyone in this new merged, restricted file has
# tage > 14
svytable( ~tage , w )
# -- yes, every record is of a person aged 15 or older.
# in fact, 17 or older.


# calculate the mean total household net worth three different ways:

# calculate the mean total household net worth
svymean( ~thhtnw , w )
# much lower than the published


# calculate the mean total household net worth, restricted to only
# households that thhtnw is not equal zero
svymean( ~thhtnw , subset( w , thhtnw != 0 ) )
# lower than the published $322,352


# calculate the mean total household net worth, restricted to only
# households that thhtnw is greater than zero
svymean( ~thhtnw , subset( w , thhtnw > 0 ) )
# still much lower than the published $322,352



# calculate the median total household net worth three different ways:


# this statistic was confirmed as the correct result using the public data by the census bureau #
# calculate the median total household net worth
svyquantile( ~thhtnw , w , 0.5 )
# quite close to the published $66,740 number
# again, the statistic above was confirmed as the correct result using the public data by the census bureau #


# calculate the median equity in own home variable,
# using only households with etenure == 1
svyquantile( ~thhtheq , subset( w , etenure == 1 ) , 0.5 )
# this matches the published number exactly

# calculate the mean equity in own home variable..
svymean( ~thhtheq , subset( w , etenure == 1 ) )
# lower than the published $135,850
# again, because the topcoding removed important outliers



# calculate the median net worth (excluding equity in own home)
svyquantile( ~as.numeric( thhtnw - thhtheq ) , w , 0.5 )
# $15,102 -- this is almost the same as the published number of $15,000
# and is possibly the result of a different quantile calculation between software
# all nine quantile calculation types are listed on
# http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/quantile.html


# note: these analysis examples are intentionally sparse
# (to focus attention on the data manipulation part, which is much harder in sipp)
# once the replicate-weighted survey design object has been created,
# any of the features described on http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/ can be used.
# all of the analysis examples shown for other survey data sets can be used on a sipp survey design too,
# so be sure to check out other data sets on http://asdfree.com/ for more thorough examples
