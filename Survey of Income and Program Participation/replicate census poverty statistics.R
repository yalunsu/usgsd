# because their table packages - available from http://www.census.gov/sipp/tables/index.html -
# get run off of an internal, non-topcoded data set.  to read more about topcoding, visit pdf page 19
# of this document.  http://www.census.gov/sipp/usrguide/chap4rev2009.pdf


# to confirm that the methodology below is correct, analysts at the census bureau
# provided me with statistics and standard errors generated using the public use file (puf)

core.kv <- 
	c( 
		# variables you almost certainly need for every calendar year analysis:
		'ssuid' , 'epppnum' , 'srotaton' , 'tage' , 'srefmon' , 'wpfinwgt' ,
		# note: the 'wpfinwgt' column does not need to be kept for calendar year analyses --
		# all weights will come from external files, not from inside the core files
	
		# variables specific to this analysis:
		
		# income and poverty variables
		'thtotinc' , 'rhpov' , 'tptotinc' , 'tpearn' ,
		
		# household and family reference person variables

# # # # # # # # # # # # #
# calendar month access #
# if an analysis requires specific a specific month on the calendar, instead of 'srefmon = 4' use 'rhcalmn = #' where # is 1 through 12
# this alternative is not as desirable, however, because:
	# a) only one of the four rotation groups will have been interviewed in the month of the calendar (the other three will be more prone to memory-bias)
	# b) questions and variables available only in the topical modules (not the core files) reflect the month prior to the interview, and will not be available at other time periods
	# c) the odds are 75% that you must stack multiple waves.  to figure out which two waves to stack, look at pdf page 5 of http://www.census.gov/sipp/usrguide/ch2_nov20.pdf
		# for example, point in time for 'february 2009' would require stacking waves 2 and 3.  so use this sql string:

		# sql.string <- 
			# paste( 
				# "select" , 
				# paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , 
				# "from w2 where rhcalyr = 2009 AND rhcalmn = 2" ,
				# "union select" , 
				# paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , 
				# "from w3 where rhcalyr = 2009 AND rhcalmn = 2" 
			# )
			
		# and make your tablename variable something else, since it's no longer just w2 or w3.
		# tablename <- 'feb09'

	# to replicate the poverty statistics run by the census bureau,
	# simply pull the august 2008 records from a single wave
	
	sql.string <- 
		paste( 
			"select" , 
			paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , 
			"from w1 where rhcalyr = 2008 AND rhcalmn = 8" 
		)
		
	# and make your tablename variable something else, since it's no longer just w2 or w3.
	tablename <- 'aug08'

# end of calendar month #

# run the sql query constructed above, save the resulting table in a new data frame called 'x' that will now be stored in RAM
x <- dbGetQuery( db , sql.string )

# look at the first six records of x

# save your data frame for quick analyses later #

# in order to bypass the above steps for future analyses,
# the data frame in its current state can be saved now
# (or, really, anytime you like).  uncomment this line:
# save( y , file = "sipp08.point.in.time.rda" )
# or, to save to another directory, specify the entire filepath
# save( y , file = "C:/My Directory/sipp08.point.in.time.rda" )

# at a later time, y can be re-accessed with the load() function
# (just make sure the current working directory has been set to the same place)
# load( "sipp08.point.in.time.rda" )
# or, if you don't set the working directory, just specify the full filepath
# load( "C:/My Directory/sipp08.point.in.time.rda" )

# rapidly create a binary (zero or one) variable
# this little gem does two things:
	# 1) test whether the `thtotinc` column (household income) is below
	# the `rhpov` column (household census poverty threshold for each record in `y` ..
	# and return a logical vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
	# 2) convert TRUEs to 1s and FALSEs to 0s, by sending the
	# whole logical vector through the as.numeric function
y$pov <- as.numeric( y$thtotinc < y$rhpov )
