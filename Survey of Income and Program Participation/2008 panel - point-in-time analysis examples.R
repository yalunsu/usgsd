# access the appropriate core wave data #

# which wave would you like to pull?
# to see which waves correspond with what months, see http://www.census.gov/sipp/usrguide/ch2_nov20.pdf
# pages 5, 6, 7, and 8 have sipp panels 2008, 2004, 2001, and 1996, respectively
wave <- 2	
# wave 2 was conducted january 2009 - april 2009 and contains data for september 2008 - march 2009.
# remember that most months occur in multiple waves (see calendar month alternative below for more detail)


# make a character vector containing the variables that should be kept from the core file (core keep variables)
core.kv <- 
	c( 
		# variables you almost certainly need for every point-in-time analysis
		'ssuid' , 'epppnum' , 'wpfinwgt' , 'tage' , 
	
		# variables specific to this analysis
		'esex' , 'ems'
	)


# each core wave data file contains data at the person-month level.  in general, there are four records per respondent in each core wave data set.
# for most point-in-time analyses, use the fourth (most current) month,
# specifically isolated below by the 'srefmon = 4' command

# create a sql string containing the select command used to pull only a defined number of columns 
# and records containing the fourth reference month from the full core data file
sql.string <- paste0( "select " , paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , " from w" , wave , " where srefmon = 4" )
# note: this yields point-in-time data collected over a four month period.

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# calendar month alternative: #
# if an analysis requires specific a specific month on the calendar, instead of 'srefmon = 4' use 'rhcalmn = #' where # is 1 through 12
# this alternative is not as desirable, however, because:
	# a) only one of the four rotation groups will have been interviewed in the month of the calendar (the other three will be more prone to memory-bias)
	# b) questions and variables available only in the topical modules (not the core files) reflect the month prior to the interview, and will not be available at other time periods
	# c) the odds are 75% that you must stack multiple waves.  to figure out which two waves to stack, look at pdf page 5 of http://www.census.gov/sipp/usrguide/ch2_nov20.pdf
		# for example, point in time for 'february 2009' would require stacking waves 2 and 3.  so use this sql string:

		# sql.string <- 
			# paste( 
				# "select" , 
				# paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , 
				# "from w2 where rhcalyr = 2009 AND rhcalmn = 2" ,
				# "union select" , 
				# paste( core.kv , collapse = "," ) , 
				# "from w3 where rhcalyr = 2009 AND rhcalmn = 2" 
			# )
			
		# and make your tablename variable something else, since it's no longer just w2 or w3.
		# tablename <- 'feb09'

# end of calendar month alternative #

# analysis examples #

# note: these results do not match the published results exactly for two reasons:
	# 1) census bureau publications of sipp data use a different
	# file than the publicly-available one, which is topcoded, edited, and contains slightly different weights
	# 2) census bureau analysts often use the generalized variance formula (gvf)
	# to calculate the margin of error.  (i confirmed that gvf was used with the author)
	# to read about the gvf, see pdf page 4 of
	# https://www.census.gov/sipp/usrguide/chap7rev2008.pdf
		# this code calculates the standard error using fay's method automatically
		# (pdf page 3 recommends using fay's method whenever possible)
		# the generalized variance formula is an imperfect methodological shortcut,
		# but r makes it easy to calculate the error terms with the recommended methodology

# create a subset of the original survey design
# that only includes individuals aged 15+
z.15p <- subset( z , tage > 14 )

# calculate the unweighted number of ever-married americans in the data
unwtd.count( ~one , subset( z.15p , em ) )
# this number matches the count shown
# in the fourth paragraph of the first page of the report


# closely replicate the first column of table 6 (pdf page 16) in
# http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-125.pdf

# the total number of americans aged 15+
svyby( ~one , ~esex , z.15p , svytotal )	# close to the total row

# print percents, broken out by sex

# never-married
svyby( ~nm , ~esex , z.15p , svymean )

# ever-married
svyby( ~em , ~esex , z.15p , svymean )

# married once
svyby( ~m1 , ~esex , z.15p , svymean )

# still in first marriage (excludes separated)

# married twice

svyby( ~sm2 , ~esex , z.15p , svymean )

svyby( ~m3 , ~esex , z.15p , svymean )

# 90% confidence interval for never-married

# note: these analysis examples are intentionally sparse
# (to focus attention on the data manipulation part, which is much harder in sipp)
# once the replicate-weighted survey design object has been created,
# any of the features described on http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/ can be used.
# all of the analysis examples shown for other survey data sets can be used on a sipp survey design too,
